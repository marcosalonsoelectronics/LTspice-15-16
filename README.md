In this first episode we show how to create a model for a 3-phase brushless DC (BLDC) motor in LTspice. Creating a model is an excellent way to better understand the motor operation and get a good insight into its behavior.
In the second episode we will see how to implement a drive for the BLDC motor and show several simulations to verify the validity of the model.

In this second part we see how to implement a BLDCM drive in LTspice using a decoder. Then, LTspice simulations are shown to demonstrate the correct operation of the BLDCM model. Details on the operation of the motor drive are given.
